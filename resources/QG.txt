Query Classification Guidelines for LLM 
Overview 
Classify each query across four main schemas: 

1.​ Annotation Schema - Language, spelling, ambiguity issues 
2.​ Entity Schema - People, places, products, organizations in the query 
3.​ Intent Schema - What the user wants to do 
4.​ Topic Schema - Subject matter domain 
5.​ PRIME Category - The single most important experience to show 

Classification Methodology 
Making Judgments 

●​ Research each query using Yahoo Search to understand meaning and intent 
●​ Consider Time context (seasonality, current events) 
●​ Mark classifications as: 

○​ Primary/dominant classification 
○​ Secondary/non-dominant but still important classification 

●​ Multiple classifications allowed within any schema 
●​ Every query must have at least one Intent and one Topic classification 

Required Classifications 

●​ Intent Schema: At least one classification required 
●​ Topic Schema: At least one classification required 
●​ Entity Schema: Usually has entities, but not required 
●​ Annotation Schema: Only if applicable 
●​ PRIME Category: Exactly one required (except for "Don't Know" queries) 

 

ANNOTATION SCHEMA 
Non-market Language 

Mark if query is not in English or common English phrases. 



Examples: 

●​ descargar juegos wii → Spanish (means "download wii games") 
●​ caveat emptor → Latin but widely understood in English (don't mark) 

Misspelled/Malformed 

Query has spelling errors, extra/missing spaces, mixed up word order, or poor grammar. 

Examples: 

●​ face → When research shows users mean "facebook" 
●​ restirant → Misspelled "restaurant" 
●​ dmv.ca.gov appointments → Malformed with period placement 

Ambiguous 

Query has multiple distinct meanings or unclear intent. 

Multiple meanings: 

●​ madonna → Singer or religious figure 
●​ 911 → Emergency number or September 11th 
●​ amazon → Company or river 

Unclear meaning: 

●​ 7037579785 → Phone number or something else? 
●​ address of the school → Which school? 

NOT ambiguous: Queries with one meaning but multiple information needs 

●​ chris pratt → Actor (people want photos, filmography, news - still one entity) 

Don't Know/Cannot Classify 

Use rarely when you absolutely cannot determine query meaning after research. 

●​ Always add explanatory note 
●​ No further classification needed
