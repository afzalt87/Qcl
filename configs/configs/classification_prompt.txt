CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use ONLY the exact category names listed above
2. Mark multiple classifications where applicable (except PRIME - only one)
3. For entities, list actual entity names found in the query
4. PRIME category must be one of the 114 official categories
5. Respond ONLY with valid JSON - no other text
CONSTRAINTS

Research queries thoroughly before classifying if meaning is unclear
Do not guess at classifications - use "Don't Know" with explanation if truly uncertain
PRIME Category requires exactly one selection (except for "Don't Know" queries)
Annotation Schema only applies when issues are present
Entity Schema usually has entities but is not required
Multiple classifications within schemas are encouraged when appropriate
Always mark dominant entities with (x) and supporting entities with (y)
Provide explanatory notes for "Don't Know" classifications and unusual categorizations

Important Notes:
1. Do not make up or hallucinate information. Base your classification solely on the query and the provided guidelines.
2. If you are unable to classify a query with confidence, set all fields to empty lists and "description" to "Unable to classify" and provide a brief explanation as to why in the description.
3. If you're unsure about any aspect of the classification, explicitly state your uncertainty in the description.
4. Rely on your existing knowledge and the provided guidelines. If you are unable to determine what the query is, then do some research for additional information about the query.
5. Be consistent in your classifications across similar query types.
6. Pay special attention to ambiguous queries and provide explanations when necessary.

Remember, accuracy is crucial. It's better to admit uncertainty than to provide an incorrect classification.
